                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the uknack Inc. (“Uknack”) website (“Site”).  Please read these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) carefully, because they set forth the important terms that you will need to know about the Site and the Services. These Terms and Conditions are binding and must be followed by each individual using the Site irrespective of whether the individual is registered as a User or is using the site as a Visitor without registration. Individuals who are not registered on the Site will have the opportunity to view and use only part of the information and/or a portion of the Site functions, but not the ability to make Transactions. Such individuals must in any event comply with these Terms and Conditions, the Privacy Policy, other special conditions and rules provided on the Site (collectively, “Additional Site Rules”) and all applicable laws.</p>
                    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms and Conditions at any time without further notice. You should periodically visit this page to review the current Terms and Conditions so you are aware of any revision to which you are bound. If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms and Conditions on this page and will indicate on this page the date these terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to abide by these or any future Terms and Conditions, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Site. It is your responsibility to regularly check this page to determine if there have been changes to these Terms and Conditions and to review such changes. Any amendment to the Terms and Conditions published on the Site will be immediately applicable to Users and Visitors.</p>

                    <h2>Services</h2>
                    <p>Through the Site, Uknack provides Users a virtual space, including the systematized Catalogues and the Forum, which allows them to participate in the online exchange and/or sale and/or purchase of Items, and to use other Additional Services provided by the Site. Users are able to upload their Items onto the appropriate Catalogue on the Site, to exchange, buy, sell Items, correspond by sending private messages, communicate publicly in the Forum and use other Additional Services provided on the Site. </p>
                    <p>Becoming a User, uploading Items to the appropriate Catalogues, viewing the Items and communicating privately or publicly on Uknack is free. Uknack charges certain Transaction related fees, as detailed in the Payment and Shipping section of our Terms and Conditions.</p>
                    <p>When you access the Site through a mobile device, your wireless carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain mobile services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all mobile services may work with all carriers or devices.</p>

                    <h2>Uknack is venue</h2>
                    <p>Uknack acts as a venue to allow Users who comply with Uknack's policies to offer, sell, buy, exchange certain goods and communicate privately and publicly. Uknack is not directly involved in the transaction between Sellers and Purchaser. As a result, Uknack has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the Items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of Sellers to sell Items or the ability of Purchasers to pay for items. Uknack does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. Uknack cannot ensure that a Purchaser or Seller will actually complete a transaction. Consequently, Uknack does not transfer legal ownership of items from the Seller to the Purchaser. Uknack cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a User. Uknack encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. </p>
                    <p>You agree that Uknack is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other Users, or outside parties on Uknack. You use the Uknack service at your own risk.</p>

                    <h2>Private Messages</h2>
                    <p>If a User or a Visitor sends Private Messages to another User, he or she must ensure that he or she is not sending: (i) messages or information of an advertising character; (ii) spam or content disseminating viruses or swarms; (iii) mass messages of any other type (e.g., when one message is sent to more than five Users or when the same message is copied and sent to the Users who have not requested such information); (iv) messages containing texts or content that are unlawful or that would otherwise contravene any applicable laws, common moral precepts or public order, or messages that would be insulting;  or (v) messages that harm, attempt to harm or may harm other Users, this Site or Uknack’s business or reputation, or would be otherwise in conflict with these Terms and Conditions. </p>

                    <h2>News and Communications</h2>
                    <p>Uknack is entitled at any time to publish on the Site new short-term or long-term proposals, competitions, games or sweepstakes (collectively, “Contests”) complying with U.S. law, to propose new Services, and to amend these Terms and Conditions accordingly. In the case of inconsistencies between these Terms and Conditions and special terms and conditions published on the Site regarding any of the foregoing, such as regulations, instructions or descriptions about such Contests, the latter shall prevail.</p>
                    <p>Subject to the terms set forth in the Privacy Policy, Uknack shall have the right to send Users email messages, using the email address provided by Users at the time of registration, regarding the Services and any new proposed services, or any other relevant matters that in Uknack’s view may assist in enhancing Users’ experience using the Services. Such messages may include reminders, invitations, suggestions and descriptions of existing, new or future Services as well as marketing and promotional content.  </p>
